# Image Super-Resolution using CNNs

## Overview
This project implements Image Super-Resolution (ISR) using deep learning techniques. The goal is to enhance the resolution of low-quality images using neural networks.

## Features
- Supports multiple deep learning architectures (e.g., SRCNN, ESRGAN, or custom models)
- Training from scratch or fine-tuning pre-trained models
- Evaluation metrics like PSNR and SSIM
- Inference on new images

## Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by state-of-the-art super-resolution models and benchmarks from research papers.
